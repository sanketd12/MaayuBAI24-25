                "Design, develop, debug DSP/FPGA/uC based Encoder systems for watermarking audio to enable audience monitoring for TV broadcasters Systems Engineering  for SDTV/ HDTV broadcast chains involving complex HW / DSP / FPGA for processing 270 Mbps / 1.485 Gbps uncompressed video stream and AES audio streams. Enhanced product quality by using field support feedback to tighten specifications. Upgraded PCB design using ORCAD for a making an Audio encoder RoHS compliant. Designed HW to interface Dolby E Digital Audio SIMM cards with FPGA;Designedan Analog Video Synch stripper circuit to feed Dolby E Codec card. Debugged / modified FPGA VHDL using Altera Quartus / SignalTap for complex watermarking / SDI Video IP. Developed Validation Test plans for video subsystems which reduced audio-video specific field support incidents. Wrote well illustrated User Manual / SDI Quality Whitepaper and facilitated ease of use and integration of Audio Watermarking Encoders in Television Broadcast facilities. Debugged AES Audio Noise due to skipped/repeated samples caused by an unstable Audio Word/Bit clock. Created a novel SDI test signal with multiple jitter spectral peaks to weed out Encoders with poorly performing PLLs (due to poor signal integrity in their control loop) which enabled us to install only the best performing encoders. Developed a novel method to measure PLL frequency response to identify abnormal SDI PLL circuits. Designed a SDI signal quality assessment (using Eye diagrams & Jitter spectra) process at Broadcast facilities to ensure our Encoders perform under all possible jitter conditions."
